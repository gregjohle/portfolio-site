            <h2>About Greg</h2>
            <p>I started my technical journey in the United States Navy, where I learned to fix electronics. After seven years, I left the Navy with my B.S. degree and used the G.I. Bill to get my MBA.
                I then moved from fixing RADAR to programming industrial machinery. This is where I discovered my love of programming. I decided to make a jump into software development.
                Currently, I am a student in a web development course through Thinkful.</p>
            <p>I have always had a passion for learning. I love stretching my skills, abilities, and understanding of new and exciting things. I'm always looking for a new project to help me grow.</p>
